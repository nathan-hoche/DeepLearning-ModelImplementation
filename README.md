# DeepLearning Model Implementation

`Objective`: The objective of this project is to implement all the most famous deep learning models to understand the working of each model and to get a bigger panel of models to use for future projects.

## Types of Models

| Type | Model | Description | Implementation? |
|------|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| Generative | `GAN` | Generative Adversarial Network | started |
| Generative | `VAE` | Variational Autoencoder | No |
| Generative | `Autoencoder` | Autoencoder | started |
